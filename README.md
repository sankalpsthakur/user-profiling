# Customer-Genomics: Clickstream Segmentation and Temporal Prediction Models



This project aims to segment customer behavior based on clickstream data and predict future events in the customer journey. We will use machine learning models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Trees, RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers, and VAE autoencoders to accomplish this task.

# Data

The data for this project will consist of customer clickstream data, including user events, timestamps, and other relevant features. We will use this data to build a segmentation model that identifies patterns and clusters in customer behavior.

We will also use the data to build a temporal prediction model that predicts future events in the customer journey based on past behavior.

# Methodology

## clickstream_segments are for segmenting customer behaviour
## sequence_models are for temporal predictions 

We will use a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment customer behavior and predict future events. Specifically, we will use XGBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Trees for segmentation and RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers, and VAE autoencoders for temporal prediction.

We will train these models on historical clickstream data and evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

# Results

The results of this project will provide insights into customer behavior and help us better understand and predict their future actions. This will allow us to improve our customer experience and optimize our marketing and sales strategies.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, this project aims to segment customer behavior and predict future events in the customer journey using machine learning models. The results of this project will provide valuable insights into customer behavior and help us improve our customer experience and business strategies
