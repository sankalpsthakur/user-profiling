# Clickstream Lead Prediction

This project aims to predict potential leads based on clickstream data. We preprocess and engineer features from raw clickstream data, train different machine learning models, and evaluate their performance using various metrics.

The goal of this project is to provide consumer startups with tools and techniques for effectively segmenting and analyzing clickstream data. By implementing various machine learning models and techniques, businesses can improve customer understanding and tailor their marketing strategies to better meet customer needs.

The repository includes:

Preprocessing and feature engineering scripts
Model implementation and training
Evaluation and comparison of different segmentation techniques
Implementation of a consensus approach for model building


# Usage

Prepare your clickstream data and place it in the data folder. Ensure that it includes a diverse range of user behaviors, travel package preferences, and demographic information. It is recommended to use at least one full year of data to account for seasonality.
Run the preprocessing and feature engineering scripts to prepare the data for ingestion into the models.
Train individual models using the provided scripts and evaluate their performance using cross-validation.
Implement the consensus approach for model building, combining the outputs of multiple models for a more accurate and robust segmentation.
Analyze the segments and use the insights to develop targeted marketing strategies or improve the user experience.


Dependencies

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

Installation
Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file and extract it.
Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
For Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
For macOS and Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Data

The dataset is a CSV file named clickstream.csv located in the data directory. The file contains raw clickstream data with various attributes, such as timestamps, events, user agent information, etc.

Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

The project includes data preprocessing and feature engineering steps to clean and transform the raw clickstream data into a suitable format for machine learning models. We have created two modules, data_preprocessing.py and feature_engineering.py, inside the src directory containing the necessary functions for these tasks.

Model Training and Evaluation

The main script trains and evaluates four different machine learning models:

Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
XGBoost
We use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score.

Usage

To run the main script, simply execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
This will preprocess the data, engineer features, train the models, and display the performance metrics for each model.
